# Public-Scripts
Hi I'm Brad and this is my Public Script repo. I wanted to a place to share the scripts I've made while I learn PowerShell and automate various things. 

All scripts come with no warranty or guarantee they will work for you. The ones I use every day are extremely customized for my employer. These have been cut down and should work for most environments.

Feel free to use them but please give me the credit.
